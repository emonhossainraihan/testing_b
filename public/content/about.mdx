My name is Grant Sanderson.
These videos, and the [animation engine](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) behind them, began as side projects as I was wrapping up my time studying math and computer science at Stanford.

From there, I was fortunate enough to start forging a less traditional path into math outreach thanks to Khan Academy's talent search, which led me to make videos and write articles about multivariable calculus and a few other miscellaneous topics for them until the end of 2016.
Since then, my full attention has been on 3b1b.

While the majority of my work has been on these videos and the related projects around them, along the way I've had the pleasure of working with numerous other outlets in education and outreach including Quanta, Manning, Udacity, Itempool, and the Julia Lab at MIT.
Even on YouTube, some of my favorite projects in the past years have been the ones done in collaboration with others, including videos with Numberphile, Stand-up Maths, MinutePhysics, Physics Girl, Ben Eater, Smarter Every Day, and others.

If you're curious to hear more about my background and thoughts surrounding these projects, take a look at these podcasts.
